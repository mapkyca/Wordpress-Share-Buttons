Adds big share buttons to posts and open graph headers to the page.

== Description ==

This is a plugin which I use on my own blogs to add share buttons and 
open graph headers to pages in a nice way and without the overhead of 
using some of the existing twitter and facebook plugins available.

Open sourced in order to be a good Open Source citizen, but with no
expectation that it'll necessarily be used by people!

== Installation ==

1. Upload /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Unzip
3. Activate through the plugins menu
